## Description

This project was created to transform our somewhat basic fake tree into a much brighter and fun fake tree. In the days leading up to Christmas, I tested and created the programs that would run on the tree (mostly with success), and on Christmas day I snuck downstairs early in the morning to replace the basic lights on the tree with my RGB ones.
